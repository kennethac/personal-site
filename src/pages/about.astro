        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            Hey, I'm Kenneth! I'm a father, husband, disciple of Christ and software engineer. I currently work at
            <a href="https://brevium.com/">Brevium, Inc</a> and live in Utah County, UT.
        </p>

        <h2>Father & Husband</h2>
        <p>
            I believe that human relationships form the basis of human happiness and I further believe that
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng">the
                family is the most important of all such relationships</a>. I am a proud father to three amazing
            children together with my incredible wife.
        </p>

        <h2>Disciple of Christ</h2>
        <p>
            I believe in Christ and seek to follow His example and teachings in every aspect of my life. I believe that
            God creates us for a purpose and that He loves us. The greatest manifestation of that love is His own Son,
            who is the source of all good and whose atonement can save us from sin and death.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a grateful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and believe that God is preparing
            the world for His second coming.
        </p>

        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
            I discovered my passion for programming early in high school. I am humbled and grateful to have found a way
            to make a good living while &mdash; dare I say it? &mdash; <i>playing</i> at work every day. I have never
            had any skill with my hands, but I love the experience of seeing something that I've conceived, planned and
            implemented come to life on a processor.
