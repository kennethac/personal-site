When I was 16 I launched my first blog. I creatively called it _The Experiment_ and hosted it on
a [Blogger.com](https://www.blogger.com/about/). It's [still online here](https://kennethexpnum1.blogspot.com/), which
surprises me every time I stumble back upon it.

I had just started to get serious about learning to program thanks to a brand new website
called [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), which my accounting teacher in high school had introduced to me, a
moment which changed my life. I fell in love with programming, spellbound by my burgeoning ability to write JavaScript
incantations _right in the browser_ and see the browser enact my will. I loved the act of creation and
familiarity with the arcane world hovering literally keystrokes beneath the surface of the everyday world, to which
nearly everyone around me was oblivious. _The Experiment_ contains my first programs, which are nothing more than
`alert()` and `prompt()` driven text manipulation widgets that I fiddled into life right in the JavaScript console
through trial and error.

Five years later I had returned from my [LDS mission](https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mission) and
enrolled at BYU. Like almost all other freshmen, I enrolled in Writing 150. For one of my projects I started another
blog, again a Blogger website, called [Think More](https://learnthinklive.blogspot.com/). It lasted for even less time
but had more posts as I completed the requirements for the course. Again, writing was an important part of my learning,
but this time purely by requiring me to think more deeply about subjects that mattered to me, like
finding [peace through the gospel of Jesus Christ](https://learnthinklive.blogspot.com/2016/11/my-personal-narrative-finding-peace.html)
or [the dangers that technology poses to our long-term happiness](https://learnthinklive.blogspot.com/2016/09/your-technological-reality.html).

A decade later, here I am starting _another_ website. I hope that it will fulfill the roles of both of my
previous blogs, by giving me a platform for my technological learning and to think carefully as I write my thoughts and
opinions for the world. I would like to believe that I have learned a lot about programming, technology and life &mdash;
and I promise to not include any `alert()`s this time!

## Publishing today

I _can't_ promise to have any content that is well-thought-out, consistently posted, or relevant. In the last
few years, I have created several attempts at a new personal website, only to let them languish and die, never to see
the
light of day. The main reason for this is that the site was never "done," never "good enough." I never clicked publish
on that first blog post, was never willing to release that first design.

This time, I'm not letting that stop me. I'm going to click publish, even if I think the language is still clunky, or I
don't like the design, or I haven't had time to add that feature I dreamt up.

I'm just going to start.
