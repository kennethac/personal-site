description: About Kenneth Christensen
---

Hey, I'm Kenneth! I'm a father, husband, disciple of Christ and software engineer. I currently work at
[Brevium, Inc](https://brevium.com) and live in Utah County, UT.

## Father & Husband

I believe that human relationships form the basis of human happiness and I further believe that
[the family is the most important of all such relationships](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng).
I am a proud father to three amazing children together with my incredible wife.

## Disciple of Christ

I believe in Christ and seek to follow His example and teachings in every aspect of my life. I believe that
God created us for a purpose and that He loves us. The greatest manifestation of that love is His own Son,
who is the source of all good and whose atonement can save us from sin and death.

I am a grateful member of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://churchofjesuschrist.org) and believe
that God is preparing
the world for His second coming.

## Software Engineer

I discovered my passion for programming early in high school. I am humbled and grateful to have found a way
to make a good living while &mdash; dare I say it? &mdash; _playing_ at work every day. I have never
had any skill with my hands, but I love the experience of seeing something that I've conceived, planned and
implemented come to life on a computer.

I particularly enjoy working on the backend, and thrive when building systems of interconnected services architected to
work smoothly. Seeing everything come together is magical. My main expertise is in .NET/C#, JavaScript and SQL.
